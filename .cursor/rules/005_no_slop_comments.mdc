# NO SLOP COMMENTS - ZERO TOLERANCE

**NEVER write comments that restate what the code obviously does. Code should be self-documenting.**

## BANNED COMMENT PATTERNS:
- Any comment that just describes the next line of code
- Comments that restate function/method names
- Comments that describe obvious operations (create, get, set, call, return)
- Section headers for obvious groupings
- Comments explaining standard language constructs

## EXAMPLES OF BANNED COMMENTS:
```go
// ❌ BANNED - restates the code
// Create a new user
user := NewUser()

// ❌ BANNED - obvious from function name  
// Download the file from storage
data, err := storage.Download(key)

// ❌ BANNED - restates the assignment
// Set the user ID
req.UserID = userID

// ❌ BANNED - obvious from method call
// Save to database
db.Save(user)

// ❌ BANNED - section headers for obvious groupings
// Validation
if err := validate(req); err != nil { ... }

// ❌ BANNED - explains standard Go constructs
// Check for errors
if err != nil { ... }

// ❌ BANNED - restates the loop
// Iterate over items
for _, item := range items { ... }

// ❌ BANNED - obvious from the return
// Return the result
return result, nil
```

## ONLY ACCEPTABLE COMMENTS:
1. **TODOs** - `// TODO: Add rate limiting`
2. **Bug workarounds** - `// Workaround for upstream bug #1234`
3. **Non-obvious business rules** - `// Credits expire after 365 days per company policy`
4. **Complex algorithms** - `// Using Haversine formula for distance calculation`
5. **External API constraints** - `// Stripe requires amount in cents`
6. **Performance notes** - `// This query is intentionally not indexed due to write performance`

## STRICT ENFORCEMENT:
- **Default assumption**: NO COMMENT NEEDED
- **Before writing any comment**: Ask "Would a competent developer understand this code without the comment?"
- **If yes**: DELETE the comment
- **If no**: Rewrite the code to be clearer instead of adding a comment

## ZERO TOLERANCE EXAMPLES:
```go
// ❌ DELETE IMMEDIATELY
// Extract metadata using the metadata service
// Create the OriginalPhoto record builder  
// Populate metadata fields
// Download the file from storage
// Create a reader from the downloaded data
// Set metadata fields if available
// Register all known makernote parsers
// Extract image dimensions
// Extract GPS coordinates
// Count how many generated photos are processing
// Ensure file exists
// Check if user is authenticated
```

## THE RULE:
**If you can remove the comment and the code is still perfectly clear to any competent developer, the comment is BANNED and must be deleted.**
