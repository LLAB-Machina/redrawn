**Always run Makefile targets directly**

- When a task has a corresponding Make target, run it instead of re-deriving commands.
- Examples:
  - `make dev` to run API + Web locally.
  - `make api` or `make web` to run each service.
  - `make revision`, `make uphead`, `make reset-db` for database migrations.
  - `make code-gen` for OpenAPI and client generation.
  - `make lint`, `make test`, `make format`, `make build-api` for quality gates and builds.
- Respect environment prerequisites described by targets (e.g., `.env`, `DATABASE_URL`). Do not bypass Makefile logic.
